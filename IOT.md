# Thermistor-
## A thermistor is a temperature-sensitive resistor with electrical resistance that varies with temperature.
### Thermistors are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in temperature. 
### Two main types of thermistors - NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient).
### NTC-thermistors exhibit a decrease in resistance as temperature rises
###  PTC thermistors show an increase in resistance with temperature.
# Application
### Applications: Thermistors have various applications, including temperature measurement and control, inrush current limiting in power supplies,
temperature compensation in e
### Applications: Thermocouples are widely used for temperature measurement in various industrial, scientific, and commercial applications. They are known for their durability and versatility, making them suitable for environments with high temperatures, extreme conditions, and in various types of machinery and equipment.

# RTD
### RTD stands for "Resistance Temperature Detector," and it is a type of temperature sensor used for measuring temperature in a wide range of applications. RTDs are known for their high accuracy and stability. 

### Applications: RTDs are commonly used in industrial, scientific, and commercial applications where accurate temperature measurement is critical. 
They are used in sectors such as manufacturing, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), scientific research, and food processing.

# LDR-light dependent resistor
### LDR stands for "Light-Dependent Resistor," and it is a type of passive electronic component that exhibits a change in electrical resistance in response to the intensity of light falling on it. 
### Applications: LDRs are widely used in various applications, including light-sensitive switches, streetlights, camera exposure control, light meters, and many other devices that need to respond to changes in ambient light levels.

# Photo Diode
### A photodiode is a semiconductor device that converts light into an electrical current. It is designed to detect and respond to light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. 
### Application- Photodiodes are used in a wide range of applications, including optical communication systems (fiber optics), light meters, ambient light sensors in electronic devices, barcode scanners, laser range finders, and many other applications that require light detection.
