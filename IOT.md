# Thermistor-
## A thermistor is a temperature-sensitive resistor with electrical resistance that varies with temperature.
### Thermistors are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in temperature. 
### Two main types of thermistors - NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient).
### NTC-thermistors exhibit a decrease in resistance as temperature rises
###  PTC thermistors show an increase in resistance with temperature.
# Application
### Applications: Thermistors have various applications, including temperature measurement and control, inrush current limiting in power supplies,
temperature compensation in e
### Applications: Thermocouples are widely used for temperature measurement in various industrial, scientific, and commercial applications. They are known for their durability and versatility, making them suitable for environments with high temperatures, extreme conditions, and in various types of machinery and equipment.

# RTD
### RTD stands for "Resistance Temperature Detector," and it is a type of temperature sensor used for measuring temperature in a wide range of applications. RTDs are known for their high accuracy and stability. 

### Applications: RTDs are commonly used in industrial, scientific, and commercial applications where accurate temperature measurement is critical. 
They are used in sectors such as manufacturing, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), scientific research, and food processing.
