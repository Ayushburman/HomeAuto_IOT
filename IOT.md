# Thermistor-
## A thermistor is a temperature-sensitive resistor with electrical resistance that varies with temperature.
### Thermistors are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in temperature. 
### Two main types of thermistors - NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient).
### NTC-thermistors exhibit a decrease in resistance as temperature rises
###  PTC thermistors show an increase in resistance with temperature.
# Application
### Applications: Thermistors have various applications, including temperature measurement and control, inrush current limiting in power supplies,
temperature compensation in electronic circuits, and over-temperature protection in devices like batteries and motors.
