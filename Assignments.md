globally.
a. True

# Q5 Sometimes, when there is a need for the nodes to communicate directly to the Internet, 
_Tunneling______ can be used. Sometimes,there is a need for the nodes to communicate directly to the 
Internet. This is achieved by tunneling.

# Q6 What is Multi Homing

### Multi-homing, in short, refers to the practice of connecting a computer or network to multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or multiple network connections simultaneously. 
This is done to achieve redundancy, load balancing, improved reliability, and sometimes to enhance network performance.

# Q7 What is Transparent Roaming
### Transparent roaming is a concept in wireless communication that refers to a seamless and uninterrupted transition of a 
mobile device from one wireless network or access point to another without any noticeable disruption in service or data transmission.
The call is smoothly transferred from the old cell tower to the new one. Data sessions continue uninterrupted.
